<p>Has anyone ever told you that something <strong>BIG</strong> must happen on Page 25 of your screenplay? Was their description of The Big Thing vague, incoherent, or simply wrong?</p>

  It has to be very, very big. Page 25. Themes. The most spectacular. Mine's bigger. <cite>Anonymous Reader, Bigly Studios</cite>

<p>Frustrated by most existing screenwriting guides, we did what any cinephiles would do: we watched a bunch of movies. Before asking "What's good or bad?" we just asked: "What is?" Then we wrote it down.</p>
<p>We believe <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/"><em>The Big Lebowski</em></a> reveals a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic">mnemonic</a> for a canonical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">hero's journey</a>. A bowling ball travels down a lane, disappears into an unseen world, and returns to the light: tumbling and tumbling in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_return">Eternal Return</a>.</p>
<p>We recorded our hypotheses in a screenwriting <a href="the_template.html">template</a> and tested them experimentally against some <a href="examples/the_big_lebowski.html">existing</a> <a href="examples/the_matrix.html">monomythic</a> <a href="examples/my_cousin_vinny.html">features</a>. Readers are encouraged to compare the template to other films in order to confirm or disconfirm our suspicions.</p>
<p>Our template is a formula (not <em>the</em> formula) for writing a screenplay. Take it, trash it, or add to it as you like it. Storytelling is a collaborative art form best shared by everyone. If you have ideas, objections, or examples to contribute, email us here:</p>
