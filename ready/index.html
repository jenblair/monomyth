The Dude with a Thousand Faces

Has anyone ever told you that something BIG must happen on Page 25 of your screenplay?
Was their description of The Big Thing On Page 25 vague, incoherent, or simply wrong?

<blockquote>
It has to be very, very big. Page 25. Themes. The best, the most spectacular. I know it when I see it. Yours needs to be bigger.

Frustrated by most existing screenwriting guides, we did what any cinephiles would do: we watched a bunch of movies. Before asking “What’s good or bad?” we just asked: “What is?” Then we wrote it down. 

We made an amusing discovery while reviewing our notes on <em>The Big Lebowski</em> (1998): by observing the journey of a bowling ball during one frame of play, the Coen Brothers have suggested a handy guide for remembering a standard hero’s journey. The ball travels down the lane, disappears into the unseen world, and returns to the light: tumbling and tumbling in Eternal Return. 

We decided to record and share our observations here in the form of a screenwriting template. 

Is this template the only formula for writing a screenplay? No. It’s <em>a</em> template, not <em>the</em> template. Take it, trash it, or add to it - it’s up to you. Storytelling is a collaborative art form best shared by everyone; if you have ideas, objections, or examples to contribute, contact us here:
