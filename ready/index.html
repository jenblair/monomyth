<h1>The Dude with a Thousand Faces</h1>
<p>Has anyone ever told you that something <strong>BIG</strong> must happen on Page 25 of your screenplay? Was their description of The Big Thing vague, incoherent, or simply wrong?</p>
<blockquote>
  It has to be very, very big. Page 25. Themes. The best, the most spectacular. I know it when I see it. Mine's bigger. <cite>Anonymous Reader, Bigly Studios</cite>

<p>Frustrated by most existing screenwriting guides, we did what any cinephiles would do: we watched a bunch of movies. Before asking "What's good or bad?" we just asked: "What is?" Then we wrote it down.</p>
<p>We made an amusing discovery while reviewing our notes on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/"><em>The Big Lebowski</em></a> (1998): by observing the journey of a bowling ball during one frame of play, the Coen Brothers have suggested a handy guide for remembering a standard hero's journey. The ball travels down the lane, disappears into the unseen world, and returns to the light: tumbling and tumbling in Eternal Return.</p>
<p>We recorded and shared our observations here in the form of a screenwriting <a href="the_template.html">template</a>.</p>
<p>Our template is a formula (not <em>the</em> formula) for writing a screenplay. Take it, trash it, or add to it as you like it. Storytelling is a collaborative art form best shared by everyone. If you have ideas, objections, or examples to contribute, email us here:</p>
